# Edge_ML_STM32N6
This repository documents my learning journey with the STM32N6 microcontroller and EdgeML.

[UM3300](docs/reference_docs/um3300-stm32n6-dk.pdf) is the user manual for the STM32N6 dev board

[UM3249](reference_repos\STM32CubeN6\Documentation\STM32CubeN6GettingStarted.pdf) is getting started with STM32CubeN6 for STM32N6
It describes all the template projects
It describes the steps to develop an application

[AN6265](docs\reference_docs\an6265-getting-started-with-n6-in-cubeide.pdf) gives software version requirement, importing projects and debugging steps.
